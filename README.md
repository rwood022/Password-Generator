# How to use the Password Generator:

The Password Generator will allow the user to obtain a unique password with each run. This allows the user to never repeat passwords and protects them from hackers.

To begin, click the "Generate Password" button. It will prompt a series of windows to get the users desired password length between 8- 128 characters. The user will then either agree to or cancel characters for their password (uppercase, lowercase, special characters, and numbers). After the user has answered all prompt windows, a randomized password with all the users choice of characters with the users choice of length will appear in the "card body".
