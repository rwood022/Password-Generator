1. Title: Password Generator

2. Description:

Password Generator allows the user to choose their desired length and characters. It then randomizes the characters selected and presents the user unique password in the display box. To create this application, I used JavaScript. JS allowed me to utilize functions and for loops to help generate a password. 


3. How to Install and Run the Project:

To begin, click the "Generate Password" button. It will prompt a series of windows to get the users desired password length between 8- 128 characters. The user will then either agree to or cancel characters for their password (uppercase, lowercase, special characters, and numbers.) After the user has answered all prompt windows, a randomized password with all the users choice of characters with the users choice of length will appear in the "card body". 


4. How to use the Password Generator:

The Password Generator will allow the user to obtain a unique password with each run. This allows the user to never repeat passwords and protects them from hackers. 


5. Credits:

I developed this Password Generator with te help and assistance of Georgia Tech's Bootcamp TA and Tutors, W3 Schools,and FreeCodingCamp.
